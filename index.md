## The Abolition Model
<p>We must adopt the Abolition Model of law (also called the Equality Model or Nordic Model) to reduce demand by punishing sex buyers—NOT those who are sold for sex. It offers protection and social services to those being sold, as well.
This approach dramatically reduces demand for prostitution and puts pimps and traffickers out of business. Stopping the demand is the key to abolition. </p>

### Three Types of Oromo Marriage
Marriage is one of the most important rituals in Oromo culture. The custom of marriage differs in various parts of the world and every civilization produces a marriage pattern appropriate to itself (Ludlow, 1965, cited in Gemechu & Assefa., 2006). Among the Oromo society also the type, name and ceremonies differ to some degree from place to place. Generally, there are three types of marriage among the Oormo.

## Brief piece by Tigist Geme*.

Marriage is one of the most important rituals in Oromo culture. The custom of marriage differs in various parts of the world and every civilization produces a marriage pattern appropriate to itself (Ludlow, 1965, cited in Gemechu & Assefa., 2006). Among the Oromo society also the type, name and ceremonies differ to some degree from place to place. Generally, there are three types of marriage among the Oromo.

### a) Formal marriage

This type of marriage has different names in different parts of Oromia: ‘kadhaa’ (Nuro,1989), or fuudha baal-tokkee (Hussen 2000) around Arsi, ‘cida’ (Lemmesa, 2007) around Showa, and ‘Naqataa’ (Gemetchu & Assefa, 2006) in Wallaga. ‘Kadhaa’ or ‘naqataa’ is the most typical and prevalent form of marriage where the ceremony starts at the moment when marriage is first thought of and even continues after the marriage is concluded (Gemetchu & Assefa, 2006).

Traditionally, it is arranged by family and before the match takes place, they make sure that the girl’s family does not have members who are lepers, chawa-clan, crafts men such as tanner, potter etc. The groom’s parents research back seven generations to make sure that the families are not related by blood, to avoid haraamuu or incest taboo. Once this has been done, the boy’s parents then make contact with the girl’s parents through a mediator. The girl’s parents often impose conditions and the mediator will take the message to the boys parents. When the parents have reached an agreement, the man and woman get engaged (betrothed). The parent then set a wedding date and they meet all the wedding expenses (Nuro,1989, Gemechu & Assefa 2006).

### b) Informal Marriage

## i) Hawwii

According to Gemechu & Assefa (2006), this mode of marriage occurs when the boy happens to remain qeerroo (bachelor) for several reasons. Either because he is not handsome, or he is from a family of low social status, and therefore cannot pay the dowry. The boy has no consent of the family of the girl to wait long and to meet the financial and social demands of the girl’s parents. Sometimes, the girl’s mother is involved in arranging marriage of her daughter through hawwee. It is common among poor people. Youngsters resort to this kind of marriage after a lot of period of courtship that the boy approaches whom he thinks can keep secret to act on a go-between. There are places where the boy and the girl with their company can mostly wait each other. She signs an agreement saying that she was not taken against her will and she will be taken to one of the boy’s relatives until his parent prepares feast for marriage (Gemechu & Assefa2006, Nuro,1989), and that her parents are solemnly informed about her safety by elders.

## ii) Buttaa/Butii

This type of marriage takes of the following two forms. The first is when the girl has consented she is induced to be abducted. The second is accomplished by compulsion without any prior knowledge of the abduction (unlike the first form) on the part of the girl (Gemechu & Assefa, 2006).

As Gemechu and Assefa point it out in their co-authored article on the Western Macca Oromo Marriage Style, marriage by abduction is taken as option when:

- 1) a boy falls in love and she is not aware at all.

- 2) a girl’s parent is affriad that their daoughter might agree to the proposed marriage,they consprice with the would be husband to take her by force.

- 3) a girl’s parent are unwilling to agree to the proposed marriage, abduction would be resorted by boy’s family to show that they have a power to take her by force evenif her parents refused (Gemechu & Assefa, 2006; Nuro, 1989).

This informal marriage was also observable among the Salale before the government intervention and the customary law became renewed in a way committed to preserving women’s right and security.

## iii) Aseennaa

This type of marriage employs peaceful, but cunning means. According to Nuro (1989), when a girl could not get anybody who seeks her hand in marriage because she may be an ugly or her parent has an evil eye “as said to be” by the society, she chooses anyone whom she thinks would marry her. And she directly goes to his parent’s house. Gemechu & Assefa (2006) also explained that, for a women to remain unmarried into her twenties is incomprehensible, though, she must go beyond herself, called aseennaa. Therefore, when a girl is left unmarried or when her father wants to give her to some one whom she does not like, she chooses unmarried young man and runs a way to his house withought the knoweledge of the man mostly in the evening.

## iv) Conditional marriage

This type of marriage depends on the occurrence of certain incidents.

# a) Dhaala

Dhaala is a type of marriage between a women and a brother of a deceased husband or levirate (Gemechu & Assefa 2006). Among such a patrilineal community where marriage secures children to perpetuate the father’s line, it is usual for widow to be inherited by a brother of a deceased husband (Nuro,1989).

# b) Mambeeto (manbeeto)

Its conditionality is the death of one’s wife. The younger sister or relative of the late wife would be given to the widower as soon as the first wife dies (Nuro, 1989). It is known as manbeeto or mambeeto among Arsi. Among the Oromo of Tulama and Macca it is known as hirpha, literally, to ‘compensate’.

<h2>GHOST_iN_THE_SHELL 1995</h2>

  Since my family got kidnapped I have had to cope with messages and threats
  from of the prostitution crews of LOS_ANGELES_and_ATLANTA they all operate
  here ya know... ##GLOBAL_SEX_SLAVE_TRADE_and_TOURiSM hint hint. The thing now
  that 2 years nearly have passed... No one talks to me, Im destitute and I get
  random glimpses of my wives and our chldren on the street. The Main 3 I have
  spotted in prostitution aka SexSlavery. Ive lived with them
  SARTU_ERiKA_and_MUNA_aka_MUNi and I know their sexuality they are not
  prostitutes. I hate getting notices from random creepy people that you are not
  going to get your family back and may lose your penis. The agression is awful
  and now that I have lived here a while and know what my wives orgasm patterns
  look like in the real world... I know whos raping them

  <span class="firstcharacter">PiNTEREST LocksOutFATHERS</span> It has been over
  two weeks since I have logged in. I found Sartu, my kidnapped wife from
  Ethiopia via ##ALPHARETTA. The previous time I found her she exclaimed "That's
  My Husband!!", and the captors refused to let her go. Im at a point in my life
  where I have gathered my life partners. The truth is that is too much power. I
  went to ##DANCE411 in Atlanta for sometime between parenting, working as a
  ##DevOps_ENGiNEER, and ##JiUJiTSU. A group of women that are blowing up the
  RnB Chitlin_Circuit of today chose me as their dance husband... My from my
  understanding 4th cousin Muna and 8th cousin Sartu from ##ETHiO_SOMOLiA and
  about 10 other women decided we would start a business to support our artistic
  endevors and care for our children. They were all kidnapped with our children
  and sold into a ##PROSTiTUTION_MARKET_in_SOUTHERN_CALiFORNiA... As their
  husband I am blackballed from most work and denied sex... My wives are raped
  or punched in the face if they show me amorous attention, so we keep safe
  distace. We are from East Africa and our tribe was documented in
  <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com">NaTionaLGeoGRAPHiC</a>when a
  reader responed in a letter to
  <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/amazon-encounter-explorer-photographer">this article about telepathic experiances in Ethiopia, the reader was sent
    to to research this telepathic tribe in south america.. If I remember
    correctly</a>
  We have relationships outdoors, but the pimps rape them systematically for use
  in a global ##SEX_TOURiSM_TRADE. The Human traffickers stole and steal
  everything I reaccquire to get on the internet. And when I travel to use
  computers at local librays in #LOS_ANGELES_COUNTY, I am severely stalked,
  attacked, poisoned with chemical weapons and randomly aharrassed. I was using
  pinterest to serve up internet content for our large families spiritual needs.
  Those of us from
  <a href="https://advocacy4oromia.org/services/human-rights/">Africa are Muslims</a>, and we had a semi-healthy stint with Jehovahs Witnesses. So we are a very
  spiritually minded family. However many of the pimps are anti god that we are
  dealing with... People on the late night show and everything are involved.
  Long story short.. Pinterest was our watering hole. I could post content
  bulletin board #style, and interact with my wives and children in passing as
  we wait for my old job JPL to step in the CIA/FBi/US_MARSHALLS and other
  services in law enforcement has helped us contact since Erikas dissapearance
  was taken in by the ##DEKALB_COUNTY_SHRIFFs office and they told me to post
  constantly to stay visible... People dissapear when the dont post in this era

I love my life, I love my wife(vz) and seek to keep them healthy on the internet as human traffickers do thier best to silence them and annialate the population of free women explicitly denying them the right to choose thier own partner</p>
